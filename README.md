**About**

duke-api-wauth is a basic boilerplate for a node API with express. Upon installation you will be prompted for some basic information to generate a package.json file. After which a folder called NewApiProject will be created with all the necessary files and directories for a basic api server with endpoints to register a new user and to login a user. Rename this folder to anything you want then cd into the renamed folder and type either yarn install or npm i to install all the necessary node modules. Once done type yarn start or npm run server to make sure the api server runs without any problems.

TODO: Make it so the project folder can be named during the prompts.
